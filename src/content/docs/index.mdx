## What Is the Controller?

The Cloudflare Tunnel Ingress Controller watches Kubernetes `Ingress` objects and the associated `IngressClass`. When it sees routes assigned to the `cloudflare-tunnel` class, it provisions Cloudflare tunnels, starts `cloudflared` connectors, and publishes DNS records so traffic reaches the target Service securely.

### Key capabilities

- Use existing Kubernetes `Ingress` resources—no custom API types to learn.
- Automate tunnel creation, DNS record management, and `cloudflared` connector rollout.
- Provide credentials through the bundled `cloudflare-api` secret or your own secret reference.
- Observe controller activity via Kubernetes events, logs, and metrics endpoints.

## Where to Start

	<Card title="Review Configuration" icon="setting">
		Understand ingress class behaviour, secret formats, and Helm values before rolling into production.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Plan Operations" icon="status">
		Adopt GitOps workflows, monitor connector health, and manage DNS lifecycles safely.
